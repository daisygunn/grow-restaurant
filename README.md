## UX

### Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for this quiz & the features they would want.

The target audience for 'Grow' are:
- 25-35 year olds
- People that live a healthy, balanced lifestyle
- People that enjoy eating out

## Technologies Used

I have used several technologies that have enabled this design to work:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - Django is the framework that has been used to build the over project and it's apps.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Python is the core programming language used to write all of the code in this application to make it fully functional.
- [Bootstrap]()

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Used as the development environment.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
    - Used to deploy my application.
- [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/dashboard)
    - Used to create the flowchart for the project.
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
    - Used to fix the thousands of grammar errors across the project.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/)
    - Used to store the 'Contacts' data used for the application.
- [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/)
    - Used to test my code for any issues or errors.

## Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

### Using Github & Gitpod

To deploy my command-line interface application, I had to use the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template), as this enables the application to be properly viewed on Heroku using a mock terminal. 

- Click the `Use This Template` button.
- Add a repository name and brief description.
- Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
- To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
- When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
-  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under your account)
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link you copied in GitHub
6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

### Creating an Application with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial:

- The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed.

1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
2. Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
4. Select the region you are working in.

*Heroku Settings*
You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.
- In the Settings tab, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:
    - If using credentials you will need to add the credentials as a variable, the key is the name 'CREDS' and the value is the contents of your creds JSON
    - Add key: `PORT` & value `8000`
- Buildpacks are also required for proper deployment, simply click `Add buildpack` and search for the ones that you require.
    - For this project, I needed to add `Python` and `Node.js`, in this order.

*Heroku Deployment*
In the Deploy tab:
1. Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
    1. Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    2. Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    3. Choose the correct repository for your application and click on `Connect`.
2. You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the `Deploy Branch` button whenever you want a change made.
3. Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked `Deploy Branch` your application will be built and you should see the below `View` button, click this to open your application:
