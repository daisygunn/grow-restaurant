                inspired by our travels
                around the world.We are located in the heart of North London, a short walk from Finsbury Park or Crouch
                Hill station.
                All produce used within the restaurant is sourced locally and we only eat foods currently in season in
                the UK or that have a really low carbon footprint! <br>
                Everything on the menu is vegetarian but can be made vegan - our dishes are designed with nourishment in
                mind.
