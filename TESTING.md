# Manual Testing

## Epic 1 - Core website functionality
### User Stories
[Site Navigation](https://github.com/daisygunn/grow-restaurant/issues/1) / [Basic navbar & footer](https://github.com/daisygunn/grow-restaurant/issues/15) / [Informative Landing Page](https://github.com/daisygunn/grow-restaurant/issues/2) 

The homepage instanlty provides the user with all information needed to be able to navigate through the website & to gain an understanding of 'who' the restaurant is.

The navbar is self explanatory and it is also clear to the user which page they are currently on.

The footer provides all additional key information required, opening times, location and contact information. For users viewing on a larger screen an embedded google map is included.

[Contact form can be sent](https://github.com/daisygunn/grow-restaurant/issues/16)

Upon submitting the contact form the user is given a postive message to confirm that is has been sent to the website owner and an email is received with the information from the form.

Once in this admin backend, the admin user is able to access the food and drinks item model, add new items or edit/delete existing one and toggle with 'on menu' which will change which items are displayed on the 'live' menu pages respectively.
